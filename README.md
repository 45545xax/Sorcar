## About
ProcGenMod is a procedural modeling node-based system which utilises Blender and its Python API to create a visual programming environment for artists and developers. Heavily inspired by Side-FX Houdini, it presents a node editor with a variety of modular nodes to make the workflow easier and fast. Most of the nodes are blender internal operations (bpy.ops.mesh) which also makes it easier for frequent blender users to manipulate geometry. It helps the users to quickly create 3D models and control node parameters to generate limitless variations in a non-destructive manner. It also provides the users to view and edit mesh on any stage of the node network independently, with realtime updates.

## Instructions 
1. Install the file as a Blender addon (User preferences -> Install addon from file...)
2. Open Node Editor (__Do not__ remove the 3D viewport as it is required by some operations like extrude, transform, ...)
3. Navigate to "PCG Node Tree" and create a new tree
4. (Optional) Search for "Realtime Mesh Update" operator (search hotkey: Spacebar) and run it to enable active node preview. Now selecting any node will change the mesh accordingly.

_NOTE: Re-run the operator if encountered any error/exception. To stop realtime preview, press "ESC"._

5. Press Shift+A to open the nodes menu. Alternatively, navigate through tabs on the left panel in the node editor
6. Add a "Mesh Output" node and select it to display an option to refresh geometry (if not using realtime preview).

Open blender using a command prompt to view degub logs and errors, if encountered.

## Upcoming features
* Scatter nodes: Randomly scatter input mesh with variation percentage parameter
* Noise nodes: Create different types of noise (Perlin, Voronoi, Simplex, â€¦)
* Custom Python Node: Write your custom script to execute inside node-editor
* Houdini nodes (Sop, Chop, Dop, ...) directly from its documentation (https://www.sidefx.com/docs/houdini/nodes/sop/index.html)
* Node restructuring: Input Sockets (get data values), Output Sockets (store mesh info)
* Render settings nodes based on selection method of rendering
* Object dynamics controlled by nodes
* Node descriptions directly from Blender docs (if available)
* Mesh materials (object/edit mode) assignable from nodes
* Custom mesh object names
* Automatically create nodes for every object inside 3D viewport (editor link)
* Support for Blender 2.8 stable build (or when 2.8 docs are updated)
